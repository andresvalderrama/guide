### Examples

#### Hexagonal Lambda

[Hexagonal Lambda](https://github.com/focusaurus/hexagonal-lambda) is an open source example serverless application built on AWS Lambda (node.js runtime) and API Gateway. It is purely an example application but aims to be realistic and comprehensive in scope. Thus it includes:

- Unit tests that run quickly locally and offline
- Automated code coverage checking and 100% coverage
- Smoke tests runnable against the deployed application
- Full lifecycle tooling for development, debugging, building, deploying
- Deployment automation with terraform
- Secure management of secrets
- Support for multiple deployment stages
- API Documentation via OpenAPI
